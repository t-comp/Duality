# Duality

Duality is an app that hopes to bridge the dichotomy of mental health and physical health by providing access to focusing on both aspects, creating a harmony!

This is a group project for one of my Computer Sciences classes. I, along with another person work on the backend which is what is shown in this repository. Right now, we are in the development process so it will be updated periodically and when the full product is finished it will be displayed here!
